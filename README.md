# Face Detection Website 

This is a web-based project that allows users to upload an image URL and send the image to be processed by the backend, which detects and draws borders around faces in the image using a REST API.

This website uses React, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Clarifai (REST API). It was developed to show the capabilities of machine learning and to refine skills in web development.
